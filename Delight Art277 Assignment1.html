     <h1> Re:Albert Momo university application</h1>
     <hr>
     
     <p>Thank you for your recent application to join us at the Starz University science faculty to study as part of your <abbr>PHD</abbr> next year. I will answer your questions
     one by one, in the following sections.</p>
     <h2>Starting Dates</h2>
     <p>We are happy to accocomdate youstarting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if you could start at the beginning of a semester</p>
     
     <p>Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which date you prefer.</p>
     
     <p>You can find for information about important university dates on our website.</p>
     
     <h2>Subject of study </h2>
     At the Starz University we have a pretty open-minded research facility- as long as the subjects fall somewhere in the realm of science and technology.
     You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just the kinf of person we like to hve on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intruiged by are as follows, in order of priority:
     
     Turning H20 into wine, and the benefits of Resvetrol (C14H12030
 Measuring the effects on performance of funk bassplayers at temperature exceeding 30^C (86*F), when the audience size exponentially increases effect of 3* 104.)
 
 Html and CSS constructs for representing musical scores
 
 So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you expect the research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we neeed to know? Thanks.
